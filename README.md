# hello-world

Hello everyone!

My name is Julissa. I am currently a junior at National Louis University.
I was born and raised in the city of Chicago. I love trying new foods. 
One of my life goals is to travel to as many countries as I can.
I hope to gain lots of knowledge in the world of technology.
